# Programs

**Programs** is a monorepo containing the packages necessary to integrate Usher's partner programs & data collection technology into a new dApp or software environment.
These features include:

- Authentication
- Link sharing over decentralised data
- Wallet connections
- Affiliate marketing campaigns with crypto rewards

> **Project Status:**  
> Usher is live and ready to accept newly created campaigns whereby rewards can be distributed to partners that refer people to the campaign's configured destination URL. Campaigns can also include reference to Smart Contract events, whereby wallets can be connected upon invite link visits, and then tracked as referred users when their associated wallet triggers a tracked Smart Contract events.
>
> **Upcoming changes:**  
> Usher is preparing a new release where the link sharing and conversion tracking features can also be used purely for data collection and insights. While affiliate marketing rewards can still be associated to conversions, Usher is evolving the user experience to offer value through insights.
